arcc: The compiler for the Arcana Templating Engine.

BRIEF
  The arcc program can run a series of deployment actions defined within a json
  file as well as deployment actions passed as arguments. Each of these
  deployment actions can also be reversed with the --clean argument. For
  example, a single file can be compiled using the following command:

    arcc --compile-file --source /path/to/file.arcana \
      --destination /path/to/output.html

  Adding the --clean switch to this command will "clean" the previous results
  by deleting the file at "/path/to/output.html".
